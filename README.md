# JungleStoreWebApi
Simple example of using .net core Web API with a separate assembly for controllers

We wanted to keep each of our web api controller separate, hence we split each controller into specific assemblies, 
each catering to specific micro service. This we hope will help in testing, deployment and enabling teams to work separately.
